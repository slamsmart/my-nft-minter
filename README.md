# üèïÔ∏è Camp Genesis Minter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A minimal NFT minting DApp for the [Camp Network](https://camp.network), built for the **Camp x Wizz: Builder Bounty**.  
Users can connect their wallet, mint NFTs using Origin SDK, and view their collection + transaction history in a clean UI.

## üöÄ Features

- üîó Wallet connection via Origin Modal (Camp Network)
- ü™Ñ NFT minting form (Name, Creator, Upload trigger)
- üñº NFT Gallery (on-chain NFT fetch via BlockScout API)
- üìú Transaction history (paginated)
- üåê Deployed on BaseCamp Testnet

## üß† NFT Types Explained: Why Some Images Show Up, and Others Don‚Äôt

This app interacts with **two types of NFTs** on the Camp Network:

### 1. IP NFTs (File Upload NFTs ‚Äî e.g. minted via Omnihub)
- Minted by uploading a file directly.
- The file becomes the actual NFT content ‚Äî no external metadata needed.
- ‚úÖ These NFTs **display properly** in the gallery because the image is embedded and easily detected.

### 2. Metadata-based NFTs (Minted via the in-app form)
- Minted using the in-app form with **NFT Name** and **Creator Name**.
- Expected to generate a `tokenURI` pointing to metadata JSON (containing `image`, `name`, etc.).
- ‚ùå These NFTs **do not show up** in the gallery ‚Äî because the current implementation does **not** upload image/metadata to IPFS, nor generate a valid `tokenURI`.

> Even though the form asks for metadata (name/creator), without integrating IPFS storage (e.g., NFT.Storage), the minted NFT lacks proper metadata.
>
> The IPNFT smart contract used via Origin SDK **requires the app to handle metadata creation/upload** ‚Äî otherwise the NFT ends up with a missing or invalid `tokenURI`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Planned Improvement:**  
Add support for full image + metadata upload to IPFS, enabling complete NFT metadata generation for in-app minting.

## üì¶ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`
